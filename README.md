## Description
  * Note Taker is your standard note-taking application that allows to you create, save, and delete notes. To create a note, add a Title and Description. For example: you can create a Task titled Homework, and include a description for the steps of your task at hand. This application utilizes Express.js to retrieve, create, and delete data from a JSON.file. Note Taker is deployed through Heroku.
